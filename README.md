Open Tibia Node.js Server
=========================

This project was created with the intention of implement the Open Tibia protocol in Node.js.

Why?
----
Node.js can be much faster than C++ when talking about I/O. And of course, it will be a fun challenge.

Creators of the original Open Tibia Protocol
--------------------------------------------
We use as guide, this C++ sources of the protocol implementation:
